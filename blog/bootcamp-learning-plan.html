        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

        <h3><li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li></h3>
        <p>
          So far still I donâ€™t really have a long term goal or expecting career
          pathway. Same as foundation that I could finish this course well and
          find the right working place for me.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Strengths: I'm really calm and care more about others than myself, so
          even if I go to a boot camp and do a pair program with someone else, I
          don't think there will be any problems between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitation: When I start studying everyday I make a todo list, but
          sometimes I just do what I have to do roughly and don't try to learn
          more because I'm in a hurry to do it quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think it's being lazy. Every day, I plan what time and until when I
          will do something, but sometimes, if I'm lazy, I go back and forth
          between studying and using my phone.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed i yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I wish I could finish the daliy tasks without procrastinating and
          enjoy my cell phone or leisure activities.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I just want to remind myself every once in a while that I'm doing a
          good job. Otherwise, I often wonder and worry about whether I am doing
          well.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm going to wake up at 8 and start studying, and I'll ask my younger
          brother to check on me every day at 8. Also, if I have any questions,
          I will continue to ask without worrying about what other people think.
