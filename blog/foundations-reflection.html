        <h1>Foundation Reflection</h1>

        <h3>
          <li>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How to manage my own time. Because there are no one is forcing me to
            study.
          </li>
          <li>Try to think more positively rather than anxiously.</li>
          <li>
            If I was stuck on something, I would run away before, but now I'm
            trying to focus more on solving the problem.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <li>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values in programming guide ethical decision-making, prioritize
          long-term quality for sustainable solutions, and foster trust and
          collaboration within teams, enhancing effective teamwork in projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy in programming promotes effective team communication, reduces
          conflicts, boosts productivity, and facilitates iterative improvement
          through constructive feedback
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness in programming supports continuous learning and skill
          development by identifying strengths and weaknesses, effectively
          contributing towards team goals.

        <h3>
          <li>
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          To be honestly, at first, I applied here to learn coding, but I
          thought is human skill really going to help me? but as the sprint
          passed, I think it was a time where I was able to see my strengths and
          weaknesses.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think it was a bit difficult to think about because there were a lot
          of questions I had never thought of in my life.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Honestly, I think that a person's personality is more important than
          programming skills. Because being a programmer is not something you do
          alone, I think relationships with others are important.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's true that I thought spend studying human skills are waste of
          time, but if I think about it now, I was able to see my weakness and
          think about how I could overcome them and develop myself.
