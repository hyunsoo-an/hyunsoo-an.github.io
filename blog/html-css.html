      <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>

      <h3>What does it do</h3>
      <p>
        Marking an element as what inline or inline block indicates where the
        element is located and how it flows within the container.
      </p>

      <h3>What is inline</h3>
      <p>
        Inline elements: These elements disappear as needed, and no line breaks
        are forced after them. Inline elements include span, a, strong, and em.
        They are typically placed inline with most content and flow along with
        the text.
      </p>

      <h3>What is block inline</h3>
      <p>
        Inline-block elements: These elements behave similarly to inline
        elements by not forcing a new line, but they also possess some
        characteristics of block-level elements. They can have margins, padding,
        and you can set their width and height. Examples of inline-block
        elements include img, input, and button.

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <img src="Images/example1.png" alt="exmaple-1" width="650" height="200" />
      <p>
        As you can see it automatically make a space between "lnline Block" and
        "Hello, this is inline"
      </p>
      <img src="Images/example2.png" alt="exmaple-1" width="650" height="200" />
      <p>
        I have hyperlinked "inline" to other web page. as you can see tag "h1"
        is using whole line but tag "a" can only be used as large as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like "a" tag, a form that is placed on the same line with itself
        and other text or other information surrounding it is called inline. A
        tag like "h1" that uses the entire screen by itself is an inline block.
