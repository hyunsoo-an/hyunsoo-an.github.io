        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </li>

        <p>
          When I was in leadership for the first time I tended to do everything
          by myself, In every situation and decision. I think it was because I
          didn’t trust my team members and didn’t want to make little mistakes.
          but I realised that this drives me to be overwhelmed. After that, I
          started to learn how to delegate tasks to team members
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because I grew up in Korea, I think I was influenced by Korean culture
          a lot. I think it’s respect and success. In Korean culture, we need to
          respect elders and others. I always seem to think that other people
          should respect me just as I respect others. So, if I feel like someone
          doesn’t respect me, I tend to distance myself from that person.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Korea, everything is always a competition, so I should always stay
          caught up with others.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I have something I like, I tend to focus only on it. When I know
          that the path I’m taking is the right path, this will help me
          accelerate my studies. I just need someone to remind me that this is
          the right path.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. how might these affect your learning journey?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Rather than a limitation, even during break time, I feel pressured to
          do something. I can’t rest fully comfortably because I feel like I am
          behind others.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Share an example of when were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and tour reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was in a meeting where I shared my opinion, but my boss didn't
          acknowledge it due to having a different perspective. So, I engaged in
          a conversation with my boss to understand their viewpoint better, and
          I also elaborated further on why my opinion made sense to me. However,
          in the end, we couldn't come to an agreement. So, I feel like I got to
          know my boss better through this experience. And I believe that going
          through such situations makes me closer to him. I think next time,
          even if something similar happens, I'll understand his perspective.
