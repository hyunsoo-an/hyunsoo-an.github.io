        <h1>Javascript and DOM</h1>
        <h2>
          <li>
            An analogy to describe Javascript and its relationship to HTML and
            CSS
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          HTML defines the basic structure of a web page, acting like its
          skeleton. CSS, on the other hand, adds style and appearance, akin to
          its skin and blood. However, these elements alone do not make a web
          page dynamic or interactive. This is where JavaScript comes into play.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Explain “control flow” and “loops” using an example process from
            everyday life.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Taking an example from preparing for a trip: Control flow represents
          the step-by-step progression of travel preparation. Examples include
          planning a trip, choosing dates, booking airline tickets, and
          reserving a hotel. Each step cannot begin until the previous step is
          complete. Just as I decide how to travel based on the location of the
          hotel I booked and travel plans, each step progresses to the next
          depending on whether the previous step has been completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking an example of the process of organizing things: A loop is a
          process that performs repetitive tasks. For example, when organizing
          my closet, gathering and folding clothes of the same type is a
          repetitive task. Fold pants and shirts the same way I fold tops. This
          process is repeated repeatedly until the desired result is done.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          DOM (Document Object Model) is a structural representation of web
          documents also display the HTML document of a web page in a tree form.
          It serves as an interface that allows programming languages to access
          and manipulate objects within a web page. It is mainly used in
          Javescript to select, modify, and or remove elements on a web page.
        </p>
        <p>Things you can do with Javescript through DOM:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selecting Element</li>
          <li>Creating and Adding Elements</li>
          <li>Modifying Element content and attributes</li>
          <li>Handling events</li>
          <li>Changing styles</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          An array is an ordered list, and each element is accessed using an
          index (a number). The index of an array starts at 0.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/array1.png" alt="Array Example 1" />
        <p>To access data in an array, use the index.</p>
        <img src="Images/array2.png" alt="Array Example 2" />
        <p>
          An object is a collection of key-value pairs, and each value is
          accessed using a unique key (a string). Objects are unordered, and you
          use keys to store and retrieve data.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/object1.png" alt="Object Example 1" />
        <p>To access data in an object, use the key.</p>
        <img src="Images/object2.png" alt="Object Example 2" />
        <p>
          Objects allows to access values using keys, making it easy to search
          for data regardless of order.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A function is an independently defined block of code that performs a
          specific task. Functions have several important functions and
          contribute greatly to making your code more efficient and readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Eliminating Redundant Code:</strong> Instead of writing the
          same code multiple times, you can define it once using functions and
          reuse it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Logical Code Segmentation:</strong> You can break down large
          tasks into smaller logical units. For example, you can split the user
          login process into multiple functions: input validation,
          authentication, session setup, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ease of Debugging and Testing:</strong> Since you can test
          functions individually, it becomes easier to find and fix errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Flexibility and Scalability:</strong> Using functions makes it
          easier to extend or modify code. When adding new features, there's
          often no need to significantly change existing code.
