        <h2><li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li></h2>
        <p>
          So far I don’t really have a long term goal or expecting career
          pathway. I just hope I can finish this course well and find out what I
          want to study while doing the course (Because there are many jobs
          within programmers).
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Strengths: I try to understand others. I observe others and maing an
          effort to understand them. If someone thinks differently to my
          opinion, I try to understand there thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitation: I can't multitask. So, even if I briefly think about
          something else, I find it difficult to comprehend what I'm studying at
          that moment.

        <p>
          One thing that I really want to fix is being lazy. When i start doing
          somthing, I tend to procrastinate often because of laziness. I really
          want to be productive and finish the task on time.

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I try to go to bed at 12am and wake up 8am everyday. This helps me to
          routine myself to study. I’m an introvert, so I get quiet when I meet
          people for the first time, but as time goes by, I don’t think there
          will be any problems when working with other people. I just need 8
          hours of sleep to get riad of stress.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            A commitment as how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am committed to seeking help when ever I face the challenge. But
          before I ask question to others I try to look for the answer in google
          or and videos. But still, if I fon’t understand than there are lot of
          people I know who can program to ask.

          When I post something, I wish they would just comment just any
          emoticon. This helps me to feel like I am doing well and on a correct
          path.

            committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.

        <p>
          At the moment study is my first priority. and because of this I don’t
          really need to worry about other activity or events coming up.
