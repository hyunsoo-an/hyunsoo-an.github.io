        <p>
          A growth mindset is the positive belief that one's future self can
          grow and improve beyond their current self. Future time perspective
          refers to the characteristic of planning and striving to achieve
          future goals. Grit is the tendency to make efforts to realize positive
          beliefs about the future.

        <p>
          I have never learned these things before, so everything was
          interesting, and I learned the importance of positivity in my thoughts
          and actions. I think this exercise gave me more confidence.

          When I fail a task, I think that I canâ€™t do it, but now I will try to
