        <p>
          I got stuck on so many problems, but the simple mistake I made was
          spelling mistakes. At first, I tried to find the problem by checking
          each line, but if I still couldn't find it, I got up, walked around
          the house for 3 minutes, sat down again, searched on Google, and if I
          really didn't know, I asked. However, most of the problems were due to
          incorrect spelling in the code. Every time I make a mistake like this,
          I feel a little stupid.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>Elegantly solved a problem</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If there is a problem with the code in any way, regardless of whether
          it is elegant or simple, it becomes an unsolvable problem for me. So,
          as written above, it seems to be the same regardless of format.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
            problem-solving techniques/processes
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I try to use most of them when I got stucj but most of the time I use
          Trying something, rubber ducky method, console.log, google and asking
          coaches for help.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
            made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
            time?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The reason I was reluctant to ask for help was because I was seen as
          asking too many questions. I think it was because I was wondering what
          to do if the question I asked was really simple, such as spelling or
          something basic like that.
